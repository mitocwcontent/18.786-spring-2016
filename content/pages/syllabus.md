Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

_[18.785 Number Theory I](/courses/18-785-number-theory-i-fall-2016/)_

Description
-----------

This course is the continuation of _[18.785 Number Theory I](/courses/18-785-number-theory-i-fall-2016/)_. It begins with an analysis of the quadratic case of Class Field Theory via Hilbert symbols, in order to give a more hands-on introduction to the ideas of Class Field Theory. More advanced topics in number theory are discussed in this course, such as Galois cohomology, proofs of class field theory, modular forms and automorphic forms, Galois representations, and quadratic forms.

Topics Covered
--------------

*   Quadratic extensions and Hilbert symbols
*   Homological algebra
*   Galois cohomology
*   Local class field theory via Tate cohomology
*   Brauer groups
*   Artin reciprocity and global class field theory

Textbook, References, and Lecture Notes
---------------------------------------

There is no required textbook; an annotated [bibliography]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings) and [lecture notes]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/lecture-notes) are provided.

Problem Sets
------------

There are 7 weekly [problem sets]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments).

Grading
-------

The grade will be determined by the problem set scores.
